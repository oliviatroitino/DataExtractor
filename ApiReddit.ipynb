This account then tried to extract personal information from me such as my password and got me to change the email associated with my account to one I have no access to called. I realized it was a scam at the last minute and in a haste I went to go change my password. But since the now revealed scammer had his email on file, he was able to change the password earlier this morning. I still have access thanks to a Google Pass Key i set up on my phone, but it seems like he's able to login my account at any time now.

      " Text: Estimating the exact number of Twitter (now X) users who aren’t bots is tricky because the platform doesn’t publicly release detailed breakdowns of its user base, and independent analyses vary widely. As of today, February 24, 2025, here’s what I can piece together based on available data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent claims on X and various web sources suggest a range of bot percentages. Some posts on X from early 2025 estimate that 60% to 85% of accounts could be bots, while a 2024 analysis cited in one post pegged it at around 64%. Older data, like a 2024 post mentioning 12% (about 66.7 million bots out of 600 million users), reflects sentiment from mid-2024. Web sources provide more formal estimates: for instance, one projection from late 2024 suggests X has 429 million monthly active users in 2024, with another citing 611 million in 2025. However, these numbers don’t consistently specify how many are human versus automated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most credible historical benchmark comes from Twitter’s last official public reports before it went private. In Q2 2022, X reported 237.8 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a metric that likely excludes most bots since it focuses on users who can be shown ads. Since then, Elon Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino have thrown out figures like 600 million monthly active users (MAU) in May 2024 and 225 million daily active users in November 2023, but these claims lack transparency about bots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s work with a rough estimate. If we take the 429 million MAU projected for 2024 and assume a bot percentage between 12% (the low end from 2024 X posts) and 64% (the high end from a 2024 analysis), that leaves us with:\n",
      "- **Low bot scenario (12%)**: 429 million × 0.88 = ~377 million human users.\n",
      "- **High bot scenario (64%)**: 429 million × 0.36 = ~154 million human users.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2025, if we use the 611 million MAU figure, the range becomes:\n",
      "- **12% bots**: 611 million × 0.88 = ~538 million human users.\n",
      "- **64% bots**: 611 million × 0.36 = ~220 million human users.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are broad approximations because bot definitions differ (some are obvious spam, others are subtle like automated news accounts), and X’s user base has fluctuated with policy changes and rebranding. Sentiment on X leans toward a higher bot presence, with users suggesting the real human pool is “far lower” than reported, but without hard data, it’s speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, depending on the year and bot estimate, the number of non-bot users could range from about 154 million to 538 million. The true figure is likely somewhere in between, but without fresh, official stats, I can’t pin it down precisely. What’s clear is that bots are a significant chunk of the platform, and the human user base is smaller than the headline numbers suggest.\n",

For some reason???? they thought it was me doing it (I have not the slightest interest in crypto and my account wasn't hacked), so they mass reported my account, and successfully so. However, they recognized their mistake and so this mutual messaged me and told me that if I didn't fix that, my account would be permanently suspended and law enforcement would be activated because of fraud. He told me I needed to have a discord call with some guy (whose name I forgot), I thought that was suspicious, but I recognized that my account would indeed be suspended because of these guys' stupidity.

They said I needed to change my email to be sure my account would be \"protected\" from suspension by being made part of \"X's database\". So I changed it. I know, that was pretty stupid, but the only reason it worked is because there was a suspicious login to my account from Perrysburg, Ohio a few days before, so I figured the message I got sent about some dude getting scammed out of $300+ via a DM my account sent was plausible, circumstances just kinda aligned like that. \n",

      " Text: Hey everyone! So a couple of weeks ago I got three emails all within a minute of each other that somebody from Adelaide Australia \\*I live in Mildura Australia 5 - 6 hours away roughly.\\* has logged in from an iPhone \\*Im an android user.\\* My password has been changed and a 2way Authenticator has been added to my account. I immediatly tried to log in and yeah it was true I couldn't log in anymore. I tried to submit a help form but the multiple forms have fallen on deaf ears to what I am guessing is an AI help desk consitantly saying I still have access and to just log in and not being able to help me. I've replied to every single one saying \"No I don't have access as I don't have the authenticator code because I am not the one that added it.\" But no replies after that. I have also tried to submit a help with authenticators aswell but all I get back is the email saying to log in and they will see it is actually me but again no replies. I was somehow able to change my password back via emails but still cannot log in as yet again I do not have the authenticator. And all I want to do is get it sorted so I can delete my X/Twitter account and be done with the plateform. So what I want to know is, Is there anything I can do? Or is the customer service just absolutly out the window and its basically a whole \"Oh something isn't working with our website? Lol sucks to suck.\" and nobody at X actually cares sort of thing?\n",

I'm really worried that they will use my account to steal personal information (e.g., ID, credit card, info). Currently I'm unable to log into my account, and I'm not sure if attempts to reset my password have worked, because it's asking me for a code from an authenticator account, which is in the hacker's hands. I tried to file a ticket through [help.x.com](http://help.x.com) to tell them that my account has been hacked, but after 3 attempts I get is an automated message claiming that \"We’ve investigated your report and it seems like you still have control of your account\", which isn't true. Since it seems that there is no way to get in touch with them, is there any way to regain access to my access to my account, or at least to lock it so that the hacker has no way to access it anymore?

Can confirm that only 1 device has been logged into my e-mail in the last month (and that device was off last night) so no conceivable way for a hacker to have gotten the Confirmation Code directly from e-mail or via my PC (no spy-bot/malware). I did not have a phone number set up so a sim-swap is a no-go.  For me, X is PC only and I don’t even have the app on my phone. So how did they do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The “easiest” answer is that “X has been hacked internally” similar to the Admin Console hack from a few years ago. However, someone with this level of internal access would likely target higher profile targets, be able to make changes without e-mail updates, and cause significantly more impact if they were just trying to make a social/political point. These types of hacks (but not to this scale?) have been going on for over a year so you would think that X would have patched it by now if it were internal (even with their significantly reduced staff). \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I think this is external to X. However, if that is the case, how are they either getting the e-mail Confirmation Code (man-in-the-middle?) or bypassing the Confirmation Code altogether? These hacks were definitely pre-planned, pre-scripted, and do not seem to be brute-forced.\n",
