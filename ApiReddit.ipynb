They provided me Discord ID of the support person. So I informed them of my situation to clear my name. Then, the support person asked me to change email address associated with my X account which I stupidly did. They also asked me for my account statement. Now it has been 4 days and I received no reply from them and I cannot even login to my account. I submitted a support request on X website as well and they said they couldn’t verify that I am the owner of that account. What do I do now as the X support doesn’t seem to help? I even provided the email that was changed to x support. I would really like to have my account back and I’m also worried that it might be sending posts or messages that are not by me.

I scrolled through my tweets and sure enough, there’s a massive gap between May 28th and July 2nd. I know I posted during that time, I have screenshots of some of those tweets, but when I go looking for them they’re not there. I didn’t delete them and no one else has access to this account. When I looked for one of the hyperspecific ones through Google, it was there. So the tweets are still there, they’re just not searchable on Twitter itself. Wtf is going on there?\n",

I think he got it from the email that I have linked to X. Anyways, any suggestions? I don't think that reporting the tweet is enough.

He led me to someone named Benjamin Mahler on Discord. This account then tried to extract personal information from me such as my password and got me to change the email associated with my account to one I have no access to called. I realized it was a scam at the last minute and in a haste I went to go change my password. But since the now revealed scammer had his email on file, he was able to change the password earlier this morning. I still have access thanks to a Google Pass Key i set up on my phone, but it seems like he's able to login my account at any time now. I've been trying to change the email and phone number to my original, but Twitter won't allow me to and says to \"try again later\". I'm really scared that this person might destroy everything i spend years to make on this account and i really need help.

      " Text: Estimating the exact number of Twitter (now X) users who aren’t bots is tricky because the platform doesn’t publicly release detailed breakdowns of its user base, and independent analyses vary widely. As of today, February 24, 2025, here’s what I can piece together based on available data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent claims on X and various web sources suggest a range of bot percentages. Some posts on X from early 2025 estimate that 60% to 85% of accounts could be bots, while a 2024 analysis cited in one post pegged it at around 64%. Older data, like a 2024 post mentioning 12% (about 66.7 million bots out of 600 million users), reflects sentiment from mid-2024. Web sources provide more formal estimates: for instance, one projection from late 2024 suggests X has 429 million monthly active users in 2024, with another citing 611 million in 2025. However, these numbers don’t consistently specify how many are human versus automated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most credible historical benchmark comes from Twitter’s last official public reports before it went private. In Q2 2022, X reported 237.8 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a metric that likely excludes most bots since it focuses on users who can be shown ads. Since then, Elon Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino have thrown out figures like 600 million monthly active users (MAU) in May 2024 and 225 million daily active users in November 2023, but these claims lack transparency about bots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s work with a rough estimate. If we take the 429 million MAU projected for 2024 and assume a bot percentage between 12% (the low end from 2024 X posts) and 64% (the high end from a 2024 analysis), that leaves us with:\n",
      "- **Low bot scenario (12%)**: 429 million × 0.88 = ~377 million human users.\n",
      "- **High bot scenario (64%)**: 429 million × 0.36 = ~154 million human users.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2025, if we use the 611 million MAU figure, the range becomes:\n",
      "- **12% bots**: 611 million × 0.88 = ~538 million human users.\n",
      "- **64% bots**: 611 million × 0.36 = ~220 million human users.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are broad approximations because bot definitions differ (some are obvious spam, others are subtle like automated news accounts), and X’s user base has fluctuated with policy changes and rebranding. Sentiment on X leans toward a higher bot presence, with users suggesting the real human pool is “far lower” than reported, but without hard data, it’s speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, depending on the year and bot estimate, the number of non-bot users could range from about 154 million to 538 million. The true figure is likely somewhere in between, but without fresh, official stats, I can’t pin it down precisely. What’s clear is that bots are a significant chunk of the platform, and the human user base is smaller than the headline numbers suggest.\n",
