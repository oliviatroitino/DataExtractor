AutoModerator,"# Greetings!

&;

This is the monthly ""Open Discussion"" thread, where you're free to ask questions, start a discussion, promote your Twitter account, give ideas on how to improve this subreddit, or provide feedback on how this subreddit is moderated.

&;

This thread is for your support questions, discussions, self-promotion, subreddit feedback, or anything else.

&;

IF YOU ARE POSTING ABOUT UN/SUSPENDED, LOCKED OR AGE-LOCKED ACCOUNTS (PROBLEMS & QUESTIONS), THIS IS TO BE DONE IN THIS THREAD ONLY.

&;

Stand-alone threads about Twitter Account Suspensions or Twitter Account Locks are unwelcome anywhere else in this subreddit. They \*Will Be Removed\* and Locked.

&;

If you're looking for more guidance on How To Get Your Suspended Account Back, [read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/suspended).

&;

Don't forget to read our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/faq), and if you have information to add to it or something that needs updating, please feel free to make those changes!

&;

&;

&;

While r/Twitter aims to be a community to help other Twitter users solve problems with the service, this also isn't the ideal place to ask support questions.

&;

Support questions are preferably asked in this ""Open Discussion"" thread. If you've posted a thread asking for help and no one has responded, you may have better luck asking your question here instead.

&;

If you do have a functional (meaning: not locked or suspended) Twitter account, it can't hurt to let @ TwitterSupport know of your problem directly on Twitter dot com.

&;

If you are looking to promote your Twitter account to others, ask for followers, or any type of self-promotion, you can do so in this thread only.

&;

The volunteer moderators who guide the direction of this subreddit rely upon the feedback of the community in order to make it a more perfect place on Reddit.

&;

Feel free to give that feedback in this thread, or if you'd prefer to give your feedback in private, \[send a private message to the subreddit [modmail](https://new.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Twitter).

DblHR,"Hi!

A while back, my friend had a problem with posts are not showing up in the hashtag search feed.

Account of my friend contains nsfw artwork, he is a digital artist. A year ago this problem seemed to be fixed, but now we're seeing the same thing again - posts in the tag search are not showing up in the latest ones. And, in the tab “Popular” post can appear, but with a very small chance.

Initially I thought the problem was due to nsfw on the account, but the feed is also full of 18+ content, some posts are not even tagged as sensetive content

I checked all the tips in the Twitter Help Center, none of it helped. One of the three tests for shadow ban on twitter showed that there is a search ban.

Maybe someone has experienced something like this? Are there any conditional solutions? Is there any point in submitting requests somewhere? (considering that DM supports are only available to premium users I certainly doubt it)",[],[],[],[],[]

I posted a piece of art last night, realized it had an error, took it down this morning, fixed it, then tried posting it again and now i can't post anything at all. Even posts that are just text won't go through.

i looked online and only found threads of people complaining about similar issues, but no answers. How do i fix this??? How long until Twitter lets me post again??

nameera_w,"Hello everyone, need help in regaining access to my account. I received a dm from a follower who I had never talked to before that they mistakenly reported my account for hacking and scamming them. They said they informed X support about this issue (they sent an email screenshot as well) and that I need to submit an appeal to them too as it’s a serious issue. They provided me Discord ID of the support person. So I informed them of my situation to clear my name. Then, the support person asked me to change email address associated with my X account which I stupidly did. They also asked me for my account statement. Now it has been 4 days and I received no reply from them and I cannot even login to my account. I submitted a support request on X website as well and they said they couldn’t verify that I am the owner of that account. What do I do now as the X support doesn’t seem to help?

curufea,"Estimating the exact number of Twitter (now X) users who aren’t bots is tricky because the platform doesn’t publicly release detailed breakdowns of its user base, and independent analyses vary widely. As of today, February 24, 2025, here’s what I can piece together based on available data.

Recent claims on X and various web sources suggest a range of bot percentages. Some posts on X from early 2025 estimate that 60% to 85% of accounts could be bots, while a 2024 analysis cited in one post pegged it at around 64%. Older data, like a 2024 post mentioning 12% (about 66.7 million bots out of 600 million users), reflects sentiment from mid-2024. Web sources provide more formal estimates: for instance, one projection from late 2024 suggests X has 429 million monthly active users in 2024, with another citing 611 million in 2025. However, these numbers don’t consistently specify how many are human versus automated.

The most credible historical benchmark comes from Twitter’s last official public reports before it went private. In Q2 2022, X reported 237.8 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a metric that likely excludes most bots since it focuses on users who can be shown ads. Since then, Elon Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino have thrown out figures like 600 million monthly active users (MAU) in May 2024 and 225 million daily active users in November 2023, but these claims lack transparency about bots.

Let’s work with a rough estimate. If we take the 429 million MAU projected for 2024 and assume a bot percentage between 12% (the low end from 2024 X posts) and 64% (the high end from a 2024 analysis), that leaves us with:
- **Low bot scenario (12%)**: 429 million × 0.88 = ~377 million human users.
- **High bot scenario (64%)**: 429 million × 0.36 = ~154 million human users.

For 2025, if we use the 611 million MAU figure, the range becomes:
- **12% bots**: 611 million × 0.88 = ~538 million human users.
- **64% bots**: 611 million × 0.36 = ~220 million human users.

These are broad approximations because bot definitions differ (some are obvious spam, others are subtle like automated news accounts), and X’s user base has fluctuated with policy changes and rebranding. Sentiment on X leans toward a higher bot presence, with users suggesting the real human pool is “far lower” than reported, but without hard data, it’s speculation.

So, depending on the year and bot estimate, the number of non-bot users could range from about 154 million to 538 million. The true figure is likely somewhere in between, but without fresh, official stats, I can’t pin it down precisely. What’s clear is that bots are a significant chunk of the platform, and the human user base is smaller than the headline numbers suggest.",[],[],[],[],[]

Abusive_Lamp,"It's a long story, if you don't wanna read the whole thing, skip to the part where I get in touch with the support member. (So I DMed the...)

 I used my twitter account for artists and games alone, and today one of the artists I recently followed sent me a message, asking me ""if friends or family members had been using my account"". I said no. I discover this artists and some of their friends mass reported me because they thought I sent a shady link to said artist, they clicked on it and got scammed.
Now, this link wasn't in our dms, hell the chat wasn't even open before this morning. I'm not trying to blame the artist, shit can happen, and when you get scammed you want the culprit to be punished, I totally get it.

They specifically said ""my account was
used to gift premium+ to other
users, and I don't know who
they were. So, I lost money and
when I recovered my account
I made reports against your
account for hacking and
scamming me, since I cannot
find the @ of that user I
MISTOOK IT FOR YOUR ACCOUNT
INSTEAD.""

They then tell me they tried to explain to the X/twitter support team that they reported the WRONG ACCOUNT, and that the support team refused to listen.

They then ask me if I wanna help them take action, and I accepted. The support team told the account to compile an appeal, inform me about it, and then send me a tag of a member of the support team to HAVE ME FILE AN APPEAL TO CLEAR MY NAME.

So I DMed the @ and got in touch with this member of the support team.
They made me change the email of the twitter account, and then the fun began.
They told me ""all your transactions IDs were marked as invalid due to the impersonator"". Sounds weird to me since the person who reported me specifically said they got the wrong account, but okay I follow the instructions.
They asked me to go on banxa to restore my transaction ID. Banxa is, and I quote, ""A financial technology platform. Banxa is not a bank / authorised deposit taking institution."" They make me insert all of the data from my card and drop 150 bucks on bitcoin.

At this point my hell on earth began. They told me that when this process was done, I would get all my money back. After an hour tho, I could not stand this anymore, and I told them to give me back my money, and delete my profile. (they did give me my money back)

We tried doing this process again on a similar website, didn't work there too.

Now, do I think I was getting scammed? No, I think the member of the support team was doing their job. They sent me their linkedin profile, a X/twitter certificate, and a picture of them holding a card with their face on it, always from X/twitter.
But like, dude, why. Why do I have to use money to restore my transaction ID. And for god's sake why is the process so long, I was literally going insane waiting for 150 bucks to get back into my pockets for AN HOUR, that I could not stand the idea of waiting another one.

Exportforce,"Hello there!

I just finished my first own browserextension for a ""problem"" that annoyed the hell out of me. When posting X / Twitterposts to discord that included more than one image or a video, they only got one image or the thumbnail. And manually rewriting the URL was extremely annoying.

So I wrote a Browserextension that will add 2 new buttons to all posts. A link- and a videobutton.

The Link button will instantly copy the link to the post preformatted to fixvx.com making them instantly pastable into discord or any other social media to provide a proper preview.

The other button copies a direct link via fxtwitter.com to the video of the post you can then either use to send it as simple video embed into discord or where ever  or to download the video easily. This button of course will not make sense on non-video posts and will link you to the post itself.

You don't link fixvx.com or fxtwitter.com for these? You have an options menu where you can specify ANY domain to use for that. I know a lot o people love the girl\*\*\*\*x.com domain to use. You can even set if the domain supports text or video or both, so your selector only contains domains that actually support the feature.

FAQ:

1. Does the Extension Track, Save send back any data? NO! The Extension does nothing else than look into the HTML, find a comfy place for the buttons and that's it.

Known Problems:

1. Button formatting is not perfect. I am still figuring out how to format them properly so they are not off off pushing the other buttons away or creating a small margin
2. When you click an image to enlarge it, The extension won't add the buttons to that newly created div because of the way I read the HTML to keep the extension as small and unintrusive as possible.

If you have a hint/tipp for these, I'll gladly listen :)

Here is the Extension for all mayor browsers. If you use a clone-browser you should be able to still install the extension from the corresponding mainstore.

Kubilai_aim,"I created Brief because i believe social media should be about real thoughts—not influencers, or the pressure to perform. Twitter, in its early days, was a space for genuine expression. Over time, platforms like X and others have lost that, favoring trends and celebrity voices. With Brief, i aim to bring back that unpretentious feel.

An app like BeReal could have connected us back to the sense of participation of every member that's why the concept is : One random notification a day. Five minutes to share what's on your mind. We can't see other's people post if we haven't posted. And then after the next daily notification to just get the real pulse of the moment.

Micro-blogging is definitely a space that miss that authenticity more than any others as we are just spectators of the Elites that's what i tend to bring by not just making the next Threads or BlueSky but having a whole new concept that will unleash new usages, hoping that my message will resonates with you and to see you on Brief soon !

There is no way I could generate the “code”, I don’t know what code they want, so I contacted X support. Honestly, they are just doing half ass jobs. 

After I hit the “Contact X Support” button, I waited for hours or days for them to respond with an email. In the email, they told me to log into my account and then respond to the same email they sent me so that they know I’m the owner of the account. 

I did it, twice, on different days, because after the first time they never respond anymore. Ok so after the second time, they NEVER follow up and respond anymore.

However, my posts are still not showing up when I try to look for them using the hashtags on another account. I just post normal portrait photos of artists and they are nothing spammy (one post every few days). Does anyone know if this is normal and I should just wait it out, or is there a way to fix it?

Thanks!!",[],[],[],[],[]

They are verified accounts that don't at most have the ""unaffiliated account"" label in their description, so when they tweet they seem real, others even emphasize that they are not a parody. They promote controversial opinions and promote crypto projects and other scams where many fans are being scammed.

Gooshiiggl,"As much as I loathe what Twitter/X has mostly become, it’s still the only place I know where I can consistently find niche, funny, raw posts that are largely uncensored. I love TikTok, but I can’t stand how much I have to edit my comments just to get them to show. If someone’s acting like a clown, I want to be able to call them out—you can’t really do that on TikTok.   


Twitter also has a solid algorithm (second only to TikTok) and knows exactly what kind of “unhinged,” “chronically online” humor will tickle me. And let’s be real—where else can you easily discover and bookmark new OF creators from around the world? Say what you want about 🌽, but it’s definitely a major draw that keeps people on the platform.   


That said, the things I hate about Twitter have made me want to delete the app for good more times than I can count. I close out of it at least once a day out of pure frustration.   

1.	Prioritizing blue check responses – Nothing is worse than a viral tweet about Wicked being up for an award, and the first 100 responses I see are engagement-farming blue check accounts saying, “Wicked is a great movie! Who else enjoyed Wicked?” or “Ariana did such a great job! This movie might win an award!” Like… AI-generated nonsense. It drives me insane.  

2.	Rage-baiting, propaganda-filled accounts – So many accounts exist purely to divide Americans on social issues. Fake far-left and far-right accounts that post the most egregious lies, misinformation, and rage-bait replies. It’s exhausting, and I can’t stand it.

There is no way you can delete your account and if you search for the username you can still find the responses that handle received.

At least the handle ""disappears"" and they look like normal replies without context but deleting the account shouldn't work like that.

I deleted the profile, you MUST stop linking replies or mentions to a handle that no longer exists

TrevorTheSeaFrog,"Hey everyone,

I’m facing an issue with my Twitter account. I can’t retweet, comment, like, or post anything. When I try to add my phone number or make any changes to my account settings, I get this message:

*""Due to a recent change on your account, changes to your settings on your account are restricted temporarily. Please try again later.""*

I’ve checked my email and spam folder, but nothing is asking me to confirm anything.

I usually post 5-10 tweets a day, mostly about things I’m passionate about like video games, drawing, and anime, but admittedly it’s often similar content. The problem is that I unknowingly replied to DMs that turned out to be phishing and scams, but I’ve already blocked and deleted those accounts.

I don’t use bots, and my account is focused on art. It’s not political or controversial. I rarely use hashtags, so I don’t understand what triggered this.

I’ve reached out to Twitter support, but nothing has helped so far. Does anyone know if this kind of restriction lifts after 24-48 hours, or is my account permanently affected? I really need my account back because I have professional contacts for my art, and it’s causing a lot of problems.

Naturally, you want to report scammers but this is taking extremely long, there is no one sure way to report it in other way than ""harassment"" if you don't want your claim to be automatically rejected immediatelly. So as it stands today hacked accounts are still trying to scam people and for all my reporting there's been maybe one email from the help center where they asked me additional questions. I answered, attached some images and that's it for now.

I also lost my new main account for my trouble (the system thinks I'm the hacker trying to evade the ban?) and I've been appealing all week. Also with no response. I don't know how long I'm still supposed to wait to have my account unlocked.

Especially trying to retweet something, it's like pulling teeth. It doesn't matter how long I wait inbetween posting... I have to do it so many times. If I post on MY OWN ACCOUNT, not replying to anyone or anything, it still gives me this. I very, VERY seldomly post. Like... 5 times a day if even that. And my account is pretty old, too. I joined in 2016. And most of my 'posts' are just me randomly replying to comment chains. I post on my own page like, once or twice a week at MOST.

If I'm trying to reply to a thread I have to click ""post"" at LEAST 20 times before it will actually post the reply. Same thing for if I'm trying to submit artwork on my profile. I have to press post at least 20 times, sometimes MORE, before it will let me post.

What is causing this? Why is it ONLY happening on PC?

On mobile there is nothing like this. I can post freely with no issues.

My posts also constantly get auto-deleted on PC!

My internet is completely fine btw, very solid, even just recently got an upgrade so that isn't the issue. The problems have been persisting long since before I upgraded. What on earth can I do to fix this? What is causing it? HELP!!!",[],['https://preview.redd.it/102gdm00i8ge1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=48b9bc6fb52e6ac8bc3f6ba1c79cb2955715bb51'],[],[],[]

Lunebulle90,"I’m this close to throwing this app in the trash right where it belongs.

I’m bored of it for many reasons, I find it personally exhausting to scroll and navigate through dehumanizing and denigrating content most of the time. 

because of the bot invasion, the constant and unwanted 24/7 far-right propaganda imposed on unwilling people in their twitter timelines, the non existent moderation, the negative people acting and arguing in bad faith, the hypocrites contradicting themselves, the inability to curate what you see, the struggle to keep your page clean and under control, the impersonal interactions, the  lack of civility between people, the comically elaborate captcha just to log in, the deliberate and aggressive clickbait style engagement farming, the gaslighting, the mean-spirited/spiteful trolling and crass racism - I really don’t understand the purpose and appeal of staying on there anymore.


 Plenty of  normal and decent people are thinking the same and are coming to the same realizations as me and that's why sooner or later, there will be only racists/trolls/bots left there.

Respected Madam/Sir,

  


I’m encountering this error when trying to create a Twitter/X account, please.

“**Error:**

**Oops, something went wrong. Please try again later.**“

I’ve exhausted all troubleshooting steps—clearing my browser data, trying different browsers and internet connections—but the problem persists, please.

Could you please advise me on how to fix this, please?

I appreciate your help in advance, please.



With best wishes

dmcphx,"So I’ve been on and off Twitter (“X” now obviously) since 2009, my current account has been around since 2018, but just in the past few weeks I’ve been having this problem where my posts are getting zero public / non-follower visibility.    The *only* people that have liked my posts for the last two-ish weeks have exclusively been people that follow me.   

This is extremely irregular for my account.   Views have gone down from hundreds to thousands of views for a regular basic post down to about 40 per post.    I don’t know if it’s because I’m regularly critical of the guy who owns the site, it didn’t seem to bother anything for the past few years, but maybe they just got around to finally limiting me or whatever. 

Say I respond to someone’s tweet, okay, I can see it on my account I posted it from just fine. 

But if I go to one of my alts, go to that person’s tweet, and try and find my main account’s tweet under their post, it literally doesn’t exist.    SOMETHING has happened where my posts are now literally not visible I think unless someone is following me. 

As someone who loves engaging in discourse on this website, this has been pretty disheartening.    It makes the point of using the website go down greatly. 

I am just curious if anyone else has ever gone through this, and if there is anything I can do to get this limit lifted. 

I thought about emailing them, but if it actually is about being critical of certain people whom the leadership at “X” likes, I don’t know if I want them to look deeper at my account and see just how often I really am critical of those people lmao.    Maybe that’s stupid, but I just wanted to ask here before I maybe emailed support there.

My question:  
If I decide to use new phone number/sim card, does this new phone number/sim card need to be paid for using different bank account? Or is it fine to pay for multiple phone numbers/simcards using 1 bank account? Will X ban for something like this?

I emailed their support, but got an auto-response saying the mailbox isn't monitored anymore. The FAQ says to contact a premium support account, but I can't because my account is locked. I feel scammed and disappointed.

All e-mails were legit from X/Twitter so not a phishing scam. My X password was strong and my e-mail confirmation password is very strong. Can confirm that only 1 device has been logged into my e-mail in the last month (and that device was off last night) so no conceivable way for a hacker to have gotten the Confirmation Code directly from e-mail or via my PC (no spy-bot/malware). I did not have a phone number set up so a sim-swap is a no-go.  For me, X is PC only and I don’t even have the app on my phone. So how did they do it?

The “easiest” answer is that “X has been hacked internally” similar to the Admin Console hack from a few years ago. However, someone with this level of internal access would likely target higher profile targets, be able to make changes without e-mail updates, and cause significantly more impact if they were just trying to make a social/political point. These types of hacks (but not to this scale?) have been going on for over a year so you would think that X would have patched it by now if it were internal (even with their significantly reduced staff). 

Thus, I think this is external to X. However, if that is the case, how are they either getting the e-mail Confirmation Code (man-in-the-middle?) or bypassing the Confirmation Code altogether? These hacks were definitely pre-planned, pre-scripted, and do not seem to be brute-forced.

I just wanted to create a simple developer account; I clicked on a link through Google search. The website was a small form asking me why I need a Twitter developer account. It did not contain any terms of service details, pricing, or anything of the sort.

It then asked me to enter my credit card details (it's X, so I thought they were okay). This is not my first time being asked to enter credit card details to open a developer account.

""Submit,"" a few website errors, reloads, and finally, a landing page showing I'm subscribed to a monthly service that costs the small amount of 5300$. Good for me...

Their support is a dumb bot or an even dumber human that acts like a bot. They have a borderline-illegal no-refund policy.

Hi everyone, I need some advice regarding an issue I’m having with my Twitter account. I have over 600 posts on my account, but suddenly I can’t see any of them. It’s been more than a week now, and the problem still hasn’t resolved itself.

Here are the details:
	•	I haven’t received any violation notices or warnings.
	•	My account is private.
	•	I didn’t use any bots or third-party tools to delete my posts.
	•	I have a second account, and it’s perfectly fine—I can even see my missing posts from that account.

I’ve tried contacting Twitter through their contact page, but it’s completely useless, and I can’t find any way to get proper support.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do to fix it? Any advice would be appreciated!",[],[],[],[],[]

From what I gathered, they changed my password, phone number, and enabled 2fa on my account.

Reached out to X support and kept getting told
I still have access to my account so they aren’t going to do anything about it.

shiraco415,"The worst thing I did was pay for X premium. I had a new account (2 months old), and I was getting some subscribers here and there. For transparency, I do post some spicy content, but nothing crazy, more like suggesting things. I didn't think it would become that much of a big deal given that X has hundreds of thousands of accounts posting literal porn every day and they get almost millions of views. I always make sure to tag the photos as 'Nudity/sensitive.'

I'm thinking to myself, ""I want to appear more legit, so let me get the blue check, and also, 'hopefully,' the advertisement replay will help me get more followers."" I told myself to let go big or go home, so I paid for the $229.00 for their Premium+. That was the biggest mistake I made...

After getting my blue mark, my account got nuked. The drop in impressions was insane. Out of curiosity, I asked some of my friends to check on the hashtags and post a comment. Nothing; from my account it shows that it is there, but on their account it shows nothing. I also checked from a secondary account, and it was the same. I could not see anything from the account.

It should be illegal for a company to take your money and then nuke your account by doing the complete opposite of what premium is supposed to do. I'm so frustrated...",[],[],[229.0],[],[]
Material_Sorbet_52,"Can anyone explain what this means? There's simply no reason to think I'm spamming or engage in inauthentic behaviour, which is what the message claims.

Asome2,"I do novel censoring edits of nsfw artworks, and before I go sharing them on Twitter, I'd like to know what exactly is the etiquette for posting things like that. Until now, I've mostly gotten said images from image boards, so I've never had contact with the artists to ask for permission or anything.

  
I have never used Twitter before or social media outside of Reddit, for that matter. I've had an account for a few years, but it's done nothing but collect dust. So please explain everything with that in mind.

  
First off, I figured I should probably tag the artist, but I've heard some people don't like being tagged. Second, some of the art is of other people's characters. Do I tag that person as well? Also, how do hashtags work in general? I've never really understood them.

VladymirPlays,"Idk if there's been threads regarding this but here goes…

For context my posts (photos) get clout immediately and get shown to non-followers' timelines (first 5 mins) ending at 2k to 9k likes and averaging 300 new followers per post but there are times when my post will have a 99% follower-only in terms of likes/engagements, a suspiciously low number of views, and with 0 new followers. It's as if it's NOT BEING SHOWN TO OTHER USERS even if it the early engagement is at my usual high (100 likes in 10mins for example)

i have tested it before forgot to screenshot but here's the scenario of me deleting an original post and reposting the SAME photo, same caption same everything just reposted:

1st post: 300 likes 1.8k views after 2 hrs all from already followers (100%)

repost: 300 likes 3.3k views after only 30 mins and engagements are mixed from both followers and non-followers.

If anyone knows how to prevent this, I'd really appreciate the info because it's super frustrating when you're prepping a post that you know your followers would eat up fast enough to get clout but then gets this bug.

fresista,"hey guys! I’ve been seeing a lot of people have had the same issue as me recently— someone logs in, enables 2FA, and does nothing else? If this happened to you, here’s how I got my account back ⬇️

This happened to my account on the 10th of January. 2FA was enabled, and I was logged out, but none of my information was changed, not my password or email or any of the actual info on the account (profile picture stayed the same, no weird posts, no weird dms)
Seeing that this is happening to a lot of people, I’m assuming its some kinda security issue rn lol. But I did just get my account back here’s my method!

This only works if you still can log in (if you have the right password + the same email but you just can’t get pass the 2FA screen.) If the hacker changed your password or email and you can’t change it back, I can’t help. Sorry :( 

•

1. When you go to the X Support website (https://help.x.com/en/forms) you need to type “2FA” in the search bar. Click the first thing that appears. It’ll say “Problem with 2FA.”

2. On the dropdown of “How can we help with your account?” Click “I need to regain access to my account” 

3. On the dropdown of “Please tell us more” click “I am having a problem with two factor authentication method”

4. Fill out your info and email.

5. It may take a little bit for an automated email to come through (if you don’t receive an automated email in the same day, just do this form again the next day— you will get one eventually) but the automated email will say this ⬇️

——

“Hello,

In order for us to help you in resetting your two-factor authentication, we'll need to confirm you’re the account owner:

Please log in on https://x.com (from a desktop computer or a mobile web browser) with your username and password. 
We should receive a notification on our end, which will help us confirm that you’re the account owner. 
Please reply to this email once you've attempted to log in, and we’ll continue to help.

Thanks,

X Support”

——

6. You need to attempt to log in. After you attempted to log in, reply to the automated email. After a few hours, try again and reply again, and then another few hours, log in *again* and reply again to this same email.

7. After this first email, just continue to keep trying the replies, and also open new support forms following the method I mentioned. You can open 2 forms a day and each time an automated email comes out, try and login and then reply again telling them you’ve attempted to log in.

You have to be patient, unfortunately. I don’t think Elon has many people working there, which is why response times are so slow, but be patient and persistent! 

I lost my account on the 10th, and got it back today on the 15th after opening about 10 cases and replying that I tried logging in 20 times to those different emails.

Hopefully some of you guys can get your accounts back with this info!!! Be safe ^-^
